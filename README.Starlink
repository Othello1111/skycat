This is the ESO Skycat distribution imported into the ESO thirdparty
vendor branch. Note none of the build mechanism is used at this level,
see the directory above.

Also note that this is not Skycat official and various small-level changes
have been made that support GAIA, if you want the official Skycat go to the
ESO download site.
