This is a re-organised version of Skycat so that it will build within the
Starlink system. The various sub-packages (astrotcl, cat, rtd, skycat and
tclutil) are imported separately to the "ESO" thirdparty branch and have
starconf wrappers in the immediate sub-directories. This directory is mostly
the original top-level directory, except the build system is replaced, again
to work with our build system.

Note that this is not Skycat official and various small-level changes have
been made that support GAIA, if you want the official Skycat go to the ESO
download site.
