CAT, A Library for Accessing Astronomical Catalogs in C++, C and Tcl
---------------------------------------------------------------------

This directory contains the source code for a set of libraries for
accessing astronomical catalogs locally and over the network. The core
is written in C++. In addition, Tcl and "plain" C interfaces are
supported.

See the CHANGES file in this directory for a list of recent changes.

For installation instructions, see the file INSTALL in this directory.

See the CHANGES file in this directory for a list of recent changes.

Note: This software has been tested on HP-UX, Solaris, and Linux
with gcc (version 2.7.2.x).

Once everything has been compiled, the astrocat application may be
started as follows:

	% cd $SRCDIR/tclcat/demos
	% astrocat 

Or, for the installed version:
	
	% $INSTALLDIR/bin/astrocat 
	
You can specify a catalog to search by specifying the name on the
command line, or by selecting one from the Data-Servers menu when the
application comes up.

Note: if you want to run the application from a machine other than the
one you compiled it on, you may need to set the CAT_LIBRARY
environment variable so that the necessary Tcl source files can be
found at run time:

	% setenv CAT_LIBRARY $INSTALLDIR/lib/cat

For more information, please refer to the postscript documentation,
which can be retrieved via anon ftp from:

   ftp://ftp.archive.eso.org/pub/skycat/doc 

The sources for the man pages can be found in the source tree under
the "man" directories.
