NAME
tcscat - Tcl interface to the catalog library (TCS version)

SYNOPSIS
tcscat $instName 
$instName subcommand ...

DESCRIPTION
The "tcscat" Tcl command is the TCS (Telescope Control System) Tcl
interface to the catalog library, in particular the TcsCatalog(3C++)
class, which is a subclass of AstroCatalog(3C++).  This command
inherits all of the features of the "astrocat" Tcl command, but is
designed for use with catalogs that have a fixed number of known
columns.  See the man page for TcsCatalogObject(3C++) for a
description of the columns.

A tcscat object can read other types of catalogs, but saving a catalog
saves it in TCS format, which contains only the known columns, with
default values inserted where necessary.

SUBCOMMANDS
The tcscat Tcl command creates a new Tcl command with the same name as
its argument ($instName).  The subcommands are the same as the
"astrocat" subcommands, (see astrocat(n)). Only the behavior is
redefined.
