Astrotcl, C++ Library and Tcl Package for Astronomical Software
---------------------------------------------------------------

The Astrotcl package contains a collection of C, C++ and Tcl utilities
related to astronomical software. It contains support for manipulating
World Coordinates and images in FITS format, and image compression and
decompression. The library may be loaded dynamically as a Tcl package
or compiled into an application, with or without Tcl support.

For installation instructions, see the file INSTALL in this directory.

See the CHANGES file in this directory for a list of recent changes.

Once everything has been compiled, the compiled "wish" application can
be started as follows:

	% cd $SRCDIR/astrotcl/demos
	% astrotcl.sh

Or, for the installed version:
	
	% $INSTALLDIR/bin/astrotcl
	
This module provides a library and not an application, so the above
commands only start the "wish" application with the environment needed
to use the library.

Note that if you want to run the demo from a machine other than the
one you compiled it on, you may need to set the ASTROTCL_LIBRARY
environment variable so that the necessary Tcl source files can be
found at run time:

	% setenv ASTROTCL_LIBRARY $INSTALLDIR/lib/astrotcl

For more information, please refer to the postscript documentation,
which can be retrieved via anon ftp from:

   ftp://ftp.archive.eso.org/pub/skycat/doc 

The sources for the man pages can be found in the source tree under
the "man" directories.

astrotcl		- top level ASTROTCL directory,
                          contains the configure script, Makefile and related 
	                  scripts and information (README and INSTALL files)

  astrotcl		- Contains Tcl related C++ and itcl classes,
                          Currently this is just the Tcl package init code
	 	          and a simple Tcl "wcs" command for converting between
                          H:M:S format and degrees.

  compress              - Compression (gzip, uniz, h_compress) support

  imageio		- Image I/O support (currently only FITS)

  wcslib		- World Coordinates support
