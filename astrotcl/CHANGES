CHANGES to Astrotcl
-------------------

This file contains a list of changes to the Astrotcl software.
The latest changes are at the top.

--------------- 04.04.05 released astrotcl-1.4.9 -----------------

* Generally 'using namespace std' instead of specifying ::std
* Fixed compiler warning in wcs.c

--------------- 20.01.03 released astrotcl-1.4.8 -----------------

* Ported to gcc-3.2.1 and Tcl-8.4.1

* Fixed bug in wcslib/src/hget.c, routine ksearch, that could
  cause skycat to core dump on some FITS files. (The routine
  called strlen() on the FITS header, which was mmap'ed and might
  not contain a null char).

--------------- 13.12.01 released astrotcl-1.4.7 -----------------

* Enabled WCS coordinate conversion outside of the image area (by request).

--------------- 27.08.01 released astrotcl-1.4.6 -----------------

* Merged in minor changes from Peter Biereichel (added some #include files).

--------------- 23.08.01 released astrotcl-1.4.5 -----------------
 
* Fixed problem with boolean declaration in press.c (caused problems
  with latest linux/gcc version).

--------------- 20.09.00 released astrotcl-1.4.4 -----------------

* Removed outdated wcslib source files from astrotcl/wcslib 
  (fitsio.[ch], imhio.[ch]).

--------------- 20.09.00 released astrotcl-1.4.3 -----------------

* SAOWCS.C: Fixed a bug in the display of galactic coordinates:
  RA was being displayed in hours and the equinox was displayed as 2000. 
  Now RA is displayed in degrees and the equinox is displayed as "GALACTIC".

* Upgraded the WCS library to wcssubs-2.8.3.

* Made changes to class WorldCoords to support non-equatorial coordinates,
  such as GALACTIC and ECLIPTIC. Now, instead of an equinox value, you can
  pass in an equinox string, which may be a number (2000, 1950, etc.) or
  a name ("J2000", "B1950", "FK5", "FK4", "ECLIPTIC", "GALACTIC", ...).
  The case is not important and abbreviations are allowed (based on the
  wcscon routine in the wcssubs package).

--------------- 02.03.00 released astrotcl-1.4.2  -----------------

* Added a check for a null coordinate string in HMS.C.

---------------  15.12.99 released astrotcl-1.4.1 -----------------

* Merged in changes made by Peter Biereichel (classes WCS, SAOWCS).

---------------  02.11.99 released astrotcl-1.4 --------------------

* Fixed a bug in HMS.C dealing with leading zeros in formatting
  the seconds of RA (The previous fix was incorrect). 

---------------  25.10.99 released astrotcl-1.3 --------------------

* Merged in changes made by Peter Biereichel

---------------  09.09.99 released astrotcl-1.2.8 -------------------------

* Updated for egcs/gcc-2.95

---------------  27.07.99 released astrotcl-1.2.7 -------------------------

* wcs.c, wcspix(): added "int wcsset()" declaration
* wcs.c, wcsxinit(): temporary fix 
* wcslib/src/Makefile.in: use of 'trigod'

---------------  14.07.99 released astrotcl-1.2.7 -------------------------

* Fixed a bug in FitsIO.C that caused problems under HP-UX when loading
  FITS tables (was bad null value parameter for a cfitsio routine).

---------------  21.06.99 released astrotcl-1.2.6 -------------------------

* WorldCoords.C: removed error message generated when null
  ra or dec is passed to constructor. Now only the status
  is set (to avoid unwanted error messages when the ra or
  dec field is blank).

---------------  16.05.99 released astrotcl-1.2.5 -------------------------

* FitsIO: Merge primary header with extension header when checking
  for WCS keywords.

---------------  22.03.99 released astrotcl-1.2.4 -------------------------

* Replaced itclsh2.2 with itclsh@ITCL_VERSION@ in Makefile.in.

* compress: Moved some global declarations from gzip.h to gzip.c to
  avoid linker warnings.

---------------  14.01.99 released astrotcl-1.2.3 -------------------------

* Upgraded the cfitsio sources to version cfitsio2027 (includes ESO HIERARCH
  keyword support).

---------------  29.12.98 released astrotcl-1.2.2 -------------------------

* FitsIO.C: bug fix: set fits_ member variable in flush().

---------------  28.12.98 released astrotcl-1.2.1 -------------------------

* Rebuild tclIndex file whenever configure is run, since Tcl8 version
  is not compatible with tcl7 version (see makelinks script).

* wcslib/src/iraf2fits.c: fixed undefined ref: calloc_errchk()

* imageio/src/FitsIO.h: added #include "fitsio.h" to avoid sunpro 
  compiler error message.

* Removed -Xc option from configure.in (should not have been there).

---------------  03.12.98 released astrotcl-1.2 -------------------------

* Made some corrections to the "ESO HIERARCH" changes in the cfitsio
  sources (removed the 29 char keyword limit).

* Changed cfitsio to allow lower case letters in FITS keywords (since
  we had some files that contained these).

* Added a number of new FitsIO methods for working with HDUs and
  FITS tables.

* Added a "realloc" method for use with cfitsio that extends the size
  of an image file when needed for inserting a new FITS block.

---------------  16.11.98 released astrotcl-1.1 -------------------------

* The FitsIO C++ class is now based on the CFITSIO package (URL:
  http://legacy.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/software/fitsio).  The public
  interface is backward compatible. A number of new methods are now
  available for accessing multiple HDUs and FITS tables. The only
  incompatible change is that some invalid FITS files that were
  previously allowed may cause an error message now (For example when
  keywords contain illegal characters). 

* Modified the CFITSIO sources files fitscore.c and getkey.c to handle
  ESO HIERARCH keywords. Also added "static" to some global variables
  in compress.c to avoid name conflicts.

* Ported to Tcl8.0.3 (minor namespace changes, still compatible with
  Tcl7.6/Tk4.2/itcl2.2).

* Changed the names of 2 global variables in the compress/gzip code,
  since the same code is being used by both cfitsio and tclpro, in
  variously hacked versions. See gzip.h for details.

---------------  30.9.98 released astrotcl-1.0.16 -------------------------

* Fixed some bugs in FitsIO.C and hput.c dealing with FITS keyword insertion.

* Upgraded wcslib to (Doug Mink's) wcssubs-2.5b, which fixes some problems 
  with COE projections and includes other bug fixes.

* Changed the release structure of the astrotcl package to include the
  tclutil package. The top level Makefile and configure script
  automatically determine which packages to make.

---------------  7.9.98 released astrotcl-1.0.15 -------------------------

* HMS.C: Fixed a bug in the formatting/printing of RA values (sometimes the
  fractional part of the seconds was incorrect).

* Updated to wcssubs-2.4 (Doug Mink's wcslib, on which the SAOWCS
  C++ class is based). This fixes some bugs in the handling of
  world coordinates rotation. 

---------------  5.8.98 released astrotcl-1.0.14 -------------------------

* Added the X11 library directory to shared lib path in startup script.

* Updated to wcssubs-2.3.2 (Doug Mink's wcslib, on which the SAOWCS
  C++ class is based). This fixes a number of bugs in the handling of
  world coordinates. The FitsIO class was also updated, since it uses
  the FITS header routines in hget.c and hput.c.

* Added COE projection to wcssubs (in worldpos.c), based on previous
  patches from Andreas Wicenec.

---------------  07.07.98 released astrotcl-1.0.13 -------------------------

* Increased buf size for print method in util/src/HMS.C to avoid potential
  overflow when given bad data.

* FitsIO.[Ch]: added new static method: "FitsIO::check_compress" (was not
  a member before) so that it can be used from outside the class.

* FitsIO.C: Changed location of the temp file used when compressing or
  decompressing an image from "file.tmp" to /tmp/fitsioXXXXXX, since
  the directory that file is in may not be writable or might be on a
  CD.

---------------  19.6.98 released astrotcl-1.0.12 -------------------------

* HMS.C: When interpreting the RA value for world coordinates, assume
  decimal numbers to be in degrees and integer values to be hours.

---------------  28.5.98 released astrotcl-1.0.11 -------------------------

* FitsIO::blankImage(...), Changed generated blank images to use the
  normal colormap colors instead of all blank pixels, so that you can
  change the background color of a generated image by manipulating the
  colormap.

* ImageIO: added methods: byteSwapData() and isclear().

---------------  4.5.98 released astrotcl-1.0.10 -------------------------

* HMS.C: print 3 digits after the decimal point for seconds for
  RA values.

---------------  28.4.98 released astrotcl-1.0.9 -------------------------

* HMS.C (used by class WorldCoords): changed printing of seconds to
  always include leading zero i.e.: (42::12:03.51 instead of
  42:12:3.51 as before).

---------------  15.4.98 released astrotcl-1.0.8 -------------------------

* FitsIO.C: Added additional suffixes for automatic compression and
  decompression: ".gz" for gzip, ".Z" for UNIX compression (i.e.:
  file.fits.Z, file.fits.gz).

* Minor changes in configure script and top level makefile for shared
  libraries

* Fixed possible bug in reference counted classes (WCS, ImageIO, Mem)
  by adding check for null rep_ pointer. The pointer can be null in
  some cases (WCS, for example, when there is no WCS information).

---------------  31.03.98 released astrotcl-1.0.7 -------------------------

* Updated man pages and documentation

---------------  25.03.98 released astrotcl-1.0.6 -------------------------

* The following changes were made to make it easier to add new image
  types and new WCS functionality in derived classes and should not
  cause any change in the external interfaces:

  * Class ImageIO: removed direct dependency on FitsIO class to make
    it possible to define new image types (by deriving a subclass of
    class ImageIORep).

  * Added a WCS object to the ImageIORep class. This can be used to
    optionally add world coordinates support to an image. Since WCS is
    a reference counted class, it is possible to replace the WCS
    implementation with a new one by defining a subclass of WCSRep
    (the internal class) that has the required interface (see below).

  * Renamed the WCSRep class to SAOWCS. The new WCSRep class is now an
    abstract base class, of which SAOWCS is a subclass. The
    external interfaces are the same. The change just makes it
    possible to add new WCS implementations in subclasses.

* Compress: Upgraded to new "press" library routines to fix bug found in
  H-compress code (Bug was only in decompression).

---------------  05.03.98 released astrotcl-1.0.5 -------------------------

* Added static method: "set_options" to class Compress, so that you can
  specify scale and smoothing options for H_COMPRESS.

---------------  13.2.98 released astrotcl-1.0.4 -------------------------

* Minor changes/fixes in wcslib.

---------------  9.2.98 released astrotcl-1.0.3 -------------------------

* Fixed accuracy problems converting pixel to wcs distance.

* Fixed problems with floating point precision when converting world
  coordinates (raised from default of 6 digits to max 17 digits.)

--------------- 3.2.98 released astrotcl-1.0.2 --------------------------

* added "long int" versions of the ImageIO and FitsIO class "get" and
  "put" methods for reading and writing keywords.

* added option to Tcl wcs command to support converting a single hh:mm:ss 
  value to floating point and back (previous version required ra and dec,
  new version will also convert a single value, so that it can more easily
  be used in expressions).

--------------- 26.01.98 released astrotcl-1.0.1 ------------------------

* WCS: There was a problem converting a WCS distance to a pixel
  distance on certain images (HST, for example), since the CDELT1 and
  CDELT2 keywords were not always defined. This has been changed now
  to use wcsWidth/pixWidth, which is known.

--------------- released astrotcl-1.0 -----------------------------------

* Compress: Fixed bug in h_comp.h (H_COMPRESS), so that it now works
  on Linux (inserted calls to htonl and ntohl where needed to make it
  portable).

* Created new package "Astrotcl" by gathering general astronomy
  related Tcl and C++ code from other packages into a single, reusable
  package.
