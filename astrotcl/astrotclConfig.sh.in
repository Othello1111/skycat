# astrotclConfig.sh --
# 
# This shell script (for sh) is generated automatically by Astrotcl's
# configure script.  It will create shell variables for most of
# the configuration options discovered by the configure script.
# This script is intended to be included by the configure scripts
# for Astrotcl extensions so that they don't have to figure this all
# out for themselves.  This file does not duplicate information
# already provided by tclConfig.sh, so you may need to use that
# file in addition to this one.
#
# The information in this file is specific to a single platform.

# Astrotcl's version number.

# The name of the Astrotcl library:

# String to pass to linker to pick up the Astrotcl library from its
# installed directory.

# Location of the top-level source directories from which Astrotcl
# was built.  This is the directory that contains generic, unix, etc.
# If Astrotcl was compiled in a different place than the directory
# containing the source files, this points to the location of the sources,
# not the location where Astrotcl was compiled.
