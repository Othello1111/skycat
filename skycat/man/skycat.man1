NAME
skycat - A tool for displaying astronomical images and catalogs

SYNOPSIS
skycat ?filename? ?-option value ...?

OPTIONS
?-file filename?
	Specify a FITS file to display. '-' means read the file from
	the standard input.  The '-file' part is optional, so you can
	also simply specify a file name. Image compression and
	decompression is done automatically, based on the file name
	suffix: .gzfits or .gfits for GZIP compression, .hfits for
	H-compress, and .cfits for UNIX compression.

-cat bool
	If bool is 1, include 'Data-Servers' menu in the menubar (This
	is the default). The 'Data-Servers' menu gives you access to
	the ESO Archive extensions for browsing astronomical catalogs,
	plotting objects in the image window and getting images over
	the network from the image servers, such as the Digitized Sky
	server.

-rtd bool
	If bool is 1, include the Real-Time menu in the menubar
	(default is 0). The Real-Time menu gives you access to the VLT
	Real-Time Display features, such as camera control and rapid
	frames. To use these features, the rtdServer daemon must be
	running on the local host. A client application, linked with
	the Rtd image event library can then send images via shared
	memory to be displayed in rapid succession. 

-float_panel bool
	If the option value is 1, the skycat info panel is put in a
	separate popup window, leaving more space for the image window
	(The default is off).

-panel_layout <saoimage | reverse | default>
	With this option you can change the order of the zoom and pan
	windows in the layout. The default layout is: zoom window on
	the left, info panel in the center and pan window right. If
	"-panel_layout saoimage" is specified, a layout similar to
	saoimage is used (info panel, pan window, zoom window). If
	"-panel_layout reverse" is specified, the order of the windows
	is the reverse of the default.

-remote bool
	If "-remote 1" is specified and a skycat process is already
	running, the existing skycat process is sent a message and
	asked to open a new window and the new skycat process exits
	immediately. This has the advantage of sharing the image
	colormap and using fewer system resources, however it depends
	on being able to use the Tcl send mechanism. For security
	reasons, Tcl send will not work if you are using "xhost" based
	X security. You need to use X-auth security. See the "Tcl/Tk
	Tools" book from O'Reilly for more on this topic.

-min_scale n
-max_scale n
	Specify the min and max scale values for the Magnification
	menu.  Negative values shrink the image, positive values zoom
	in closer. The default values are -10 and 20.

-port portnum
	Specify a port number to use for the remote RTD socket
	interface. See the Rtd User's Guide for details on this socket
	based interface. By default, a port number is chosen
	automatically and written to the file ~/.rtd-remote.

-disp_image_icon bool
	If bool is 1 (default), display a miniature version of the
	image in the tool's icon window.

-default_cmap <cmap>
	Specify the default colormap. This should be one of the names
	listed in the 'Colors' popup window (default is 'real'). 

-default_itt <itt>
	Specify the default intensity transfer table. This should be
	one of the names listed in the 'Colors' popup window (default
	is 'ramp').

-colorramp_height <pixels>
	This option can be used to change the height of color bar (the
	widget at the bottom of the screen displaying the image
	colors).

-with_colorramp bool
	If bool is true, display the color bar (default).

-with_zoom_window bool
	If bool is true, display the zoom window (default).

-with_pan_window bool 
	If bool is true, display the pan window (default).

-dozoom bool
	If bool is true, turn the zoom window on automatically
	(default).

DESCRIPTION
The ESO Skycat tool combines the image display capabilities of the RTD
(Real-Time Display) with a set of classes for accessing astronomical
catalogs locally and over the network using HTTP. The tool allows you
to view FITS images from files or from the Digitized Sky Survey (DSS).

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
$SKYCAT_CONFIG 
	If set, this is used as the URL to access the skycat
	configuration file, which contains the list of available
	catalogs and how to query them. By default, the configuration
	file is also searched for in $HOME/.skycat/skycat.cfg, and if
	that is not found, in the ESO default URL:
	http://archive.eso.org/skycat/skycat2.0.cfg.

$SKYCAT_PLUGIN
	If set, this variable should be a colon separated list of
	files or directories containing skycat plugins. A skycat
	plugin is a Tcl script that defines a Tcl proc to be called
	for each instance of the main window. The script is sourced
	before any windows are created and can also load shared
	libraries dynamically to add new features.  See the Skycat
	User's Guide (ftp://ftp.archive.eso.org/pub/skycat/docs) for
	more information.

FILES
	http://archive.eso.org/skycat/skycat2.0.cfg - default 
	configuration file.
