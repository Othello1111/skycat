<P>
The ESO AstroCatalog library allows applications to access remote
databases, catalogues and archives across the internet.  It is used by
the ESO <I>skycat</I> image display tool and various other
applications.  In order to make a database accessible to the
AstroCatalog library a `server' must be provided for it.  This server
will accept remote queries sent in a standardised format, interrogate
the database and return a table of results corresponding to the objects
in the database which satisfied the query.  These notes are intended to
assist in writing such a server.  They should be used in conjunction
with listings for one or more existing servers.
<P>
The communication between the remote application and the server uses the
Hyper-Text Transfer Protocol (HTTP)  developed for the World Wide Web.
The servers are, strictly speaking, <I>gateways</I> using the Common
Gateway Interface (CGI).  One way of thinking of the remote application
is as a very specialised Web browser.  One consequence of this approach
is that if a site is to provide an AstroCatalog server it must also be
running a Web server.  The HTTP and CGI protocols are, of course,
enormously flexible and there are additional protocols and conventions
for communicating between an AstroCatalog application and server.  These
protocols and conventions are described in subsequent sections.  The
format for queries is described in Section&nbsp;<A HREF="skycat-server.html#QUERY">3</A> and that for
the returned results in Section&nbsp;<A HREF="skycat-server.html#TAB">4</A>.
<P>
Though the protocols for communicating between an AstroCatalog
application and server are (reasonably) well defined, there are an
unlimited number of ways in which a server could be written to accept
standard queries and return standard results.  Thus, these notes cannot
prescribe how a server must be written, but merely suggest some
alternatives.  An AstroCatalog server is a CGI script and CGI scripts
are usually (but not necessarily) written in Perl.  For the rest of
these notes I shall assume that the server is to be implemented as a
Perl script.  The entire server could be written in Perl, with the
database being accessed directly from the Perl script.  However, it is
more likely that the Perl script will invoke a Database Management
System (DBMS) or special-purpose program to interrogate the database.
<P>
This document assumes that you have some familiarity with the
AstroCatalog library or, at least, <I>skycat</I>.  The AstroCatalog
library is documented in <I>Astronomical Catalog Library Interface
Specification</I> by Allan&nbsp;Brighton.  It also assumes that you are familiar
with HTTP, writing CGI scripts and Perl.  There are numerous books
describing the HTTP and CGI protocols.  <I>The HTML Source Book</I>
by Ian Graham seems to be a particularly good one.  Similarly there
are various books on Perl.  <I>Learning Perl</I> by Randall&nbsp;Schwartz
and <I>Programming Perl</I> by Larry&nbsp;Wall and Randall&nbsp;Schwartz are
comprehensive and easy to use.
<P>
<H1><A NAME="SECTION00030000000000000000">Accessing a New Server with the AstroCatalog Library</A></H1>
<P>
It might seem perverse to describe how to access a new server with
the AstroCatalog library before describing how to write the server.
However, access to the new server will often be the first thing that
you set up, so that you can try it out during development and debugging.
<P>
The servers for catalogues, databases and archives are identified to
the AstroCatalog library using a syntax of the form:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE> <I>name</I><TT>@</TT><I>location</I>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
where <I>name</I> is an abbreviation for the name of the catalogue
and <I>location</I> an abbreviation for the institution where it is
held.  By convention both <I>name</I> and <I>location</I> are usually
quite short.  For example:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE> <TT>ppm@eso</TT>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
is the abbreviation for the version of Bastian and Roeser's <I>
accents?</I> <I>Positions and Proper Motion</I> catalogue available at ESO.
<P>
A list of all the catalogues, databases and archives which the
AstroCatalog library can access is held in a configuration file.
You must take a copy of this configuration file, add details for your
new server and then instruct your copy of the AstroCatalog library
to access this modified file.
<P>
By default the AstroCatalog library uses a configuration file kept at
ESO.  You can retrieve a copy of it from URL:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE> <TT>http://archive.eso.org/skycat/skycat2.0.cfg</TT>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
To access your own copy of this file you must place it in a directory
accessible to your local HTTP server (that is, one which is `visible to
the Web').  Then set environment variable <TT>SKYCAT_CONFIG</TT> to a 
URL which points to this file.
<P>
You must now add an entry for your catalogue to this file.  The file is
simply a text file which can be modified with a text editor.  It
contains extensive comments which should be read in conjunction with
these notes.
<P>
For example, the entry for the PPM catalogue is:
<P>
<PRE>serv_type:      catalog
long_name:      PPM at ESO
short_name:     ppm@eso
url:            http://archive.eso.org/skycat/servers/ppm-server...
symbol:         mag circle 15-$mag</PRE>
<P>
The purposes of the various items are as follows.
<P>
<DL ><DT><STRONG><TT>serv_type:</TT></STRONG>
<DD> The alternatives are: <TT>catalog</TT>,
   <TT>archive</TT>, <TT>namesvr</TT> or <TT>imagesvr</TT>.
   <TT>catalog</TT> is the simplest and most common option; it used for
   simple catalogues and tables.  A <TT>serv_type</TT> of <TT>catalog</TT> is
   assumed in the rest of these notes.  See Section 2 of the <I>
   Astronomical Catalog Library Interface Specification</I> for a
   discussion of the alternatives.
<P>
  <DT><STRONG><TT>long_name:</TT></STRONG>
<DD> A name or short (one-line) description of
   the catalogue.  It is intended to be read by humans rather than
   interpretted by computer.
<P>
  <DT><STRONG><TT>short_name:</TT></STRONG>
<DD> The name used to identify the server to the
   AstroCatalog library.
<P>
  <DT><STRONG><TT>url:</TT></STRONG>
<DD> The URL used to access the server.  Following the
   usual conventions for a CGI gateway it consists of the directory
   specification and file name of the server followed by parameters
   passed to the server to define the query (see Section&nbsp;<A HREF="skycat-server.html#QUERY">3</A>).
<P>
  <DT><STRONG><TT>symbol:</TT></STRONG>
<DD> Defines the plotting symbol to be used; see the
   comments in the configuration file for details.
<P>
 </DL>
<P>
<TT>symbol</TT> is optional; the other items are mandatory.
<P>
Finally, if you want your server to become generally available then
remember to send either the details or your modified configuration file
to the skycat/AstroCatalog library team at ESO.
<P>
<H1><A NAME="SECTION00040000000000000000">Query parameters</A></H1>
<P>
<A NAME="QUERY">&#160;</A>
<P>
The parameters at the end of the server URL pass values which define
the query which objects in the catalogue must satisfy if they are to be
selected.  The types of queries which are currently supported are mostly
concerned with selecting objects within a specified region of sky.  The
region may be either:
<P>
<UL><LI> `circular' - within a given angular distance of a specified
   central point,<LI> `annular' - within an annulus defined by a minimum and maximum
   angular distance from a specified central point,<LI> `rectangular' - within a region bounded by specified great
   circles of Right Ascension and parallels of Declination.
<P>
</UL>
<P>
The query parameters are as follows.
<P>
<DL ><DT><STRONG><TT>%ra</TT></STRONG>
<DD> Right Ascension of the central position specified
   as sexagesimal hours <I>check</I> in J2000 coordinates.
<P>
  <DT><STRONG><TT>%dec</TT></STRONG>
<DD> Declination of the central position specified
   as sexagesimal degrees in J2000 coordinates.
<P>
  <DT><STRONG><TT>%r1</TT></STRONG>
<DD> The minimum radius for an annular query, in
   minutes of arc.  For a circular query it should be set 0.0.
<P>
  <DT><STRONG><TT>%r2</TT></STRONG>
<DD> The maximum radius for an annular query or the
   radius for a circular query, in minutes of arc.
<P>
  <DT><STRONG><TT>%w</TT></STRONG>
<DD> The width or Right Ascension range of a rectangular
   query, in minutes of arc.
<P>
  <DT><STRONG><TT>%h</TT></STRONG>
<DD> The height or Declination range of a rectangular
   query, in minutes of arc.
<P>
  <DT><STRONG><TT>%m1</TT></STRONG>
<DD> The minimum (brightest) magnitude for an object
   to be selected,
<P>
  <DT><STRONG><TT>%m2</TT></STRONG>
<DD> The maximum (faintest) magnitude for an object
   to be selected,
<P>
  <DT><STRONG><TT>%n</TT></STRONG>
<DD> The maximum number of objects to be selected.
<P>
  <DT><STRONG><TT>%cols</TT></STRONG>
<DD> A list of columns to return.  The list comprises
   a set of column names separated by commas, for example:
<P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE> <TT>col1,col2,...coln</TT>
  </BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
  <DT><STRONG><TT>%id</TT></STRONG>
<DD> <I>ID field of item to return (if supported).</I>
<P>
  <DT><STRONG><TT>%mime-type</TT></STRONG>
<DD> <I>Value for HTTP mime-type field.</I>
<P>
 </DL>
<P>
It is not always necessary (or possible) for a server to support all
sorts of queries.  For example, the minimum and maximum magnitude has
no meaning in the case of the UK Schmidt Plate Catalogue.

<P>
The query parameters to select objects within 120 minutes of arc
of 10:00:00, +30:00:00 in the PPM catalogue was:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE> <TT>http://archive.eso.org/skycat/servers/ppm-server <BR> 
&nbsp;?ra=10:00:0.00&amp;dec=+30:00:0.00&amp;radius=120&amp;nout=101</TT>
</BLOCKQUOTE><H2><A NAME="SECTION00042000000000000000">Generalised queries</A></H2>
<P>
The query parameters used by the AstroCatalog library are special
cases of a proposed general format for exchanging information between
remote astronomical information services.  A working document describing
this proposal is available at URL:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE> <code>http://archive.eso.org/~amicol/asu_94.html</code>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<I>Note that there seem to be differences between the query parameters
 currently implemented and the proposal.</I>
<P>
<H1><A NAME="SECTION00050000000000000000">Tab-separated list</A></H1>
<P>
<A NAME="TAB">&#160;</A>
<P>
The server must return the list of selected objects as a <I>
tab-separated list</I>.  The tab-separted list format is described in
Section 2.3 of <I>Astronomical Catalog Library Interface
Specification</I>.  Briefly, it is a file or other stream of bytes, in
which the values for individual fields in the list are separated by
a tab character (ASCII character 9).  A file in tab-separated list
format can be modified with a text editor.  The details of the format
are as follows.
<P>
<OL><LI> The first line of a tab-separated list must be a header.
   Usually this header will be:
<P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE> <TT>Content-type: text/plain</TT>
  </BLOCKQUOTE><LI> The next line gives the names of all the columns in the list,
   separated by tabs.<LI> The following line is a list of dashes (and tabs) which indicate
   that the table of values will follow immediately.<LI> The table follows, with one row (or object) per line.<LI> Within each line the fields corresponding to each column occur
   in the same order as the column names (given in 2 above) and are
   separated by tabs.<LI> The following two additional constraints apply:
  <UL><LI> the first column must be a name or identifier,<LI> the second and third columns must be respectively be the
     Right Ascension and Declination in decimal degrees and J2000
     coordinates.
<P>
  </UL></OL>
<P>
The optional special columns <TT>MORE</TT> and <TT>PREVIEW</TT> can be used
within information and image servers (see Section ???)
<P>
<H2><A NAME="SECTION00051000000000000000">Example</A></H2>

A tab-separated list corresponding to a some columns in a subset of the
PPM catalogue is listed below.

<OL><LI> When developing a server it is often useful to see the query
   that has been sent by the remote application.  If you are using
   <I>skycat</I> as the remote application then the last query sent to
