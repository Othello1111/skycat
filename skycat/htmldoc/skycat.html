      <em>SkyCat</em> is a tool that combines visualization of images and
      access to catalogs and archive data for astronomy.

    <p>
      See the <a href="skycat-faq.html">SkyCat FAQ</a> 
      and the 
      <a href="http://arcdev.hq.eso.org/~archeso/skycat/skycat-man.html">SkyCat Programmer's Manual</a>
      for more information.

    <p>
      You can download the latest Skycat version 
      <a href="ftp://ftp.archive.eso.org/pub/skycat/README.html">here</a>.

    <h3><em>SkyCat</em> features</h3>
    
    <ul>  
	<p><li> Display FITS images, with support for the World
	Coordinate System (WCS), interactive measurement of offsets,
	and other standard visualization functions (SAOimage-like).
	
	<p><li> Overlay and edit color graphic objects on the image,
	`tagging' sources with text, arrows, circles, or other graphic
	elements.
	
	<p><li> Display a compass indicating where north and east are in
	the image, based on the world coordinates information.

	<p><li> PostScript color printing of the display (image +
	graphics).
	
	<p><li> Access and load images from network image servers,
	such as the Digitized Sky Survey (DSS).

	<p><li> Select previously viewed images from a history menu
	and catalog. The cut levels, color scale algorithm and
	colormap settings are remembered for each image.
	
	<p><li>Access and load catalog information from a number of
	popular astronomical catalogs, such as the HST Guide Star
	Catalog and many others.
	
	<p><li>Create, search and edit local user catalogs.
 
	<p><li>Save catalog data locally. 
	
	<p><li>Overlay catalog sources on an image, taking object size
	and orientation into account.
	
	<p><li>Interact with Netscape to display more object information when
	available 
	
	<p><li>Access the observations catalog from the 
	<a href="/wdb/wdb/eso/eso_archive/form">NTT</a>, 
	<a href="/wdb/wdb/hst/science/form">HST</a> and 
	<a href="http://cadcwww.dao.nrc.ca/cfht/">CFHT</a> Science
	Archives. 
	
	<p><li>Access to SIMBAD and NED both as <em>name
	resolvers</em> as well as for information on known objects.
	
	<p><li>Retrieve preview and other compressed images and
	decompress them on the fly.

	<p><li>Retrieve and plot tabular preview data for a selected
	object as an X/Y graph.

	<p><li>Calculate, display and plot the center position, FWHM,
	angle and other information for a selected star/object.

	<p><li>Load and save compressed images in hcompress, gzip or
	UNIX compress format.

	<p><li>Access SkyCat features from a remote process via socket
	interface or Tk "send".

	<p><li>Access image header and data (FITS format) via SysV
	shared memory or mmap.
	
	<p><li>Interact with WWW browser to access catalog
	documentation and other documents.

	<p><li> Support for dynamically loaded 
	<A HREF="ftp://ftp.archive.eso.org/pub/skycat/plugins/README.html">skycat plugins</A>, 
	such as the 
	<A HREF="http://star-www.dur.ac.uk/~pdraper/gaia/gaia.html">GAIA</A> 
	plugin, that add new features or modify existing ones.

	<p><li>Load lists of catalogs from other sites (ESO, CADC, CDS, local) and and
	allow users to select a preferred default catalog list.

    </ul>

    <h3>Things we are working on</h3>

    <ul>
	<p><li>Save canvas graphics as a fits extension on the image file. 

	<p><li>User customizable symbols to "label" objects on the canvas.

	<p><li>Add a user preferences dialog.

	<p><li>Add or edit WCS parameters for a given image.

	<p><li>Add support for 16 and 24 bit color currently requires
	that the display support an 8-bit pseudocolor X visual).
    </ul>

    <h3>Caveats</h3>

    <ul>
	<p><li><b>Astrometry:</b> <em>SkyCat</em> handles the astrometric
	positions by translating pixel positions into equatorial coordinates
	(RA, DEC). This translation is based on WCS (World Coordinate System)
	FITS keywords that are included in the image header and that give the
	astrometric solution for the image. The accuracy of the solution
	varies because, in many cases, an approximation is used.
	
	<P><LI><b>Colors:</b> If you are running <I>netscape</I> or some other
	color intensive applications before you start <em>SkyCat</em>, you may
	get some color flashing when you move the mouse in and out of the
	<I>SkyCat</I> image window. This is because <I>SkyCat</I> is using a
	private colormap to get enough colors to display the image.  You can
	get around this problem by starting netscape with the "-ncols" option:
	for example:
	<pre>
      netscape -ncols 60 &amp.
	</pre>
	You can also control how many colors <I>SkyCat</I> uses via the color
	dialog in the View menu.
    </ul>

    <h3>About the software</h3>

    <em>SkyCat</em> was developed by
    <a href="/">ESO's Data Management</a> and
    <a href="http://www.eso.org/vlt/vlt.html">Very Large
      Telescope (VLT) Project</a> divisions with contributions from the
    <a href="http://cadcwww.dao.nrc.ca/">Canadian
      Astronomical Data Center (CADC)</a>.

    <p>The tool was originally conceived as a demo of the capabilities of
      the class library that we are developing for the VLT.

    <p>The Skycat sources currently consist of five packages:

    <ul>
	<p><li> <a href="http://arcdev.hq.eso.org/~archeso/skycat/tclutil">Tclutil</a> 
	- Generic Tcl and C++ utilities

	<p><li> <a href="http://arcdev.hq.eso.org/~archeso/skycat/astrotcl">Astrotcl</a>  
	- Astronomical Tcl and C++ utilities

	<p><li> <a href="http://arcdev.hq.eso.org/~archeso/skycat/rtd">RTD</a> 
	- Real-time Display classes and widgets
	(see <a href="http://www.eso.org/messenger.html">The
	  Messenger</a>, 81, 1995)

	<p><li> <a href="http://arcdev.hq.eso.org/~archeso/skycat/cat"> Catlib</a> 
	- Catalog library and widgets

	<p><li> <a href="http://arcdev.hq.eso.org/~archeso/skycat/skycat"> Skycat</a> 
	- Skycat application and library package

    </ul>

    You can get the sources from the 
    <a href="ftp://ftp.archive.eso.org/pub/skycat/README.html">skycat ftp directory</a>.
    All of the required packages are always included in the tarfile.


    <h4>Java vs Tcl/Tk</h4>

    Some users might wonder why we did this development in the Tcl/Tk
    environment rather than in Java. The main reason was the pragmatic
    need to get the functionality implemented in time for the VLT to
    come on-line (mid 1998). However, great care has been taken to
    develop as much as possible with object oriented languages (C++,
    [incr Tcl]), having in mind that the future lies in tele-scripting
    rather in the distribution of binary code.

    <h4><em>SkyCat</em> mailing list</h4>

    A mailing list has been setup to support a wide collaboration on the
    SkyCat/RTD/CatLib project. Many people have shown interest in
    participating in such a venture. You can sign up with that list <a
      href="skycat-list.html">here</a>. A hypermail <a href="list">archive</a>
    is also available.

    <h4>Distribution and support</h4>

    The <em>SkyCat</em> binaries are freely available to any users who
    want to download and use the software at their own risk. Users who wish
    to modify the source code should contact 
    <i><a href="mailto:malbrech@eso.org">malbrech@eso.org</a></i>.

    <p><em>SkyCat</em> is available as an executable for these platforms:

    <p>

      <a href="ftp://ftp.archive.eso.org/pub/skycat/README.html">Solaris (SunOS-5.5.1)</a>
      <br> 
      <a href="ftp://ftp.archive.eso.org/pub/skycat/README.html">HP-UX-10.20</a>
      <br> 
      <a href="ftp://ftp.archive.eso.org/pub/skycat/README.html">Linux</a>

    <p>ESO will maintain the Sun Solaris and HP versions in the longer
      term. They are the platforms on which VLT software will run. ESO does
      not have the resources to port to and maintain <em>SkyCat</em> on any
      other platforms. We will be glad to redistribute any port that other
      people or groups may support but decline any responsibility for them.

    <p>The software is available as source code for research and other
      non-profit organizations. If you are interested to obtain the package
      send us a note.

    <h3>Acknowledgments</h3>

    We very much appreciated practicing <em>wishful programming</em> at
    large, i.e. wishing a utility, a function or just a code fragment that
    would just do that bit you badly need, then surfing the net, fetching it
    and re-using it in our code. Here is an incomplete list of packages
    that we either partially re-used or gave a source of inspiration.

    <ul>
	<p><li>STARCAT contributed many of its internals.

	<p><li><a href="http://www.scriptics.com/">Tcl/Tk</a>, 
	TclX, BLT, Tix, ET and Itcl give the glue around the C++ classes,
	Tk provides the canvas graphics.
	
	<p><li><a href="http://tdc-www.harvard.edu/software/saoimage/">SAOimage</a>
	lent the <a href="ftp://cfa-ftp.harvard.edu/pub/gsc/WCSTools/">WCS lib</a>
	(now a separate package, provided by courtesy of 
	<a href="mailto:mink@cfa.harvard.edu">Doug Mink</a>).
	
	<p><li><a href="gsc-engine/gsc-engine.html">

	<a href="http://simbad.u-strasbg.fr/Simbad">SIMBAD</a>
	and <a href="http://nedwww.ipac.caltech.edu/">NED</a>
	client routines allow name resolving.
	
	<p><li>The <a href="http://cadcwww.dao.nrc.ca/">CADC</a>
	<em>press</em> library is used to
	automatically compress and decompress (hcompress, gzip, ...)
	images.
	
	<p><li><a href="http://www.eso.org/projects/esomidas/">Midas</a>
	routines are used to calculate the centroid position, FWHM and angle of selected stars/objects.
    </ul>
