CHANGES to Skycat
-----------------

This file contains a list of changes to the Skycat software and user
interface. The latest changes are at the top.

---------------  16.11.98 released skycat-2.2b1 -----------------------

* Added support for multiple FITS HDUs. Now, when you open a FITS file
  with multiple HDUs, a windows is displayed where you can choose
  which parts to display. FITS tables are displayed as local
  catalogs. Small versions of the images are displayed in a table, in
  the correct orientation, if posible, using the values of the CRPIX*
  keywords.  Clicking on an image displays it in the main window.

* Ported Skycat to tcl8.0.3/BLT2.4f/Scriptics TclPro 
  (But still compatible with tcl7.6/tk4.2/BLT2.1)

  - Updated namespace syntax
    Changed "class" to "itcl::class"
    Added namespace prefixes where needed (for itcl member procs)

  - Updated BLT references where needed (for BLT-2.1 or 2.4f)

  - Added a "tclpro" directory that replaces the "et" directory when
    building a single binary version for Tcl8. The Et code doesn't work
    with Tcl8, so the Tclpro product from Scripts is used instead, if it
    is available (and in your shell $PATH). 
    Note: The Skycat configure scripts still looks for the tclConfig.sh 
    file, so you still need to have a normal "tcl8" build directory
    installed, or at least copy the necessary files. See the Skycat
    INSTALL file for details.

* SkySearch.tcl: Fixed a problem linking catalog objects to line
  numbers when sorting was turned on.

* SkyCat.tcl: force full path names by -catalog option for local
  catalogs, to avoid confusion over local catalog names.

---------------  30.9.98 released skycat-2.1.3 -----------------------

* Added an image history feature, for quick access to previously
  loaded images. This includes a "Go" menu, for quick access, and
  a "History" catalog menu item under Data-Servers. Images from
  image servers need to be saved to a file in order to be put in the
  history (see below). The history catalog is also used to save
  information about each file, such as the colormap and cut level
  settings.

* Added a dialog to ask the user if an image from an image server
  should be saved to a file before loading another image, so that file
  can be put in the image history list.

* Added an automatically generated "history" catalog containing
  information about previously viewed images.

* Skycat now automatically saves and restores the main window size and
  position between sessions.

---------------  23.8.98 released skycat-2.1.2 -----------------------

* Updated HTML docs

---------------  7.8.98 released skycat-2.1.1 ------------------------

* Changed -remote option to reuse the same image window and interpret
  only image and catalog arguments. This makes it easier to use skycat
  as a netscape application, for example: "skycat -remote 1 %s".
  For catalogs, you can also do: "skycat -remote 1 -catalog %s".

* Added changes in SkyQuery.tcl to support image servers (see cat/CHANGES).

* Catalogs: The "Select Area" button no longer pops up a message
  window telling you to drag out a region. It simply sets the mouse
  cursor (for convenience).

---------------  5.8.98 released skycat-2.1 --------------------------

* Fixed minor bug in "Select Area..." feature in catalog window: needed
  to clip selected area to be within the image.

* Added the X11 library directory to shared lib path in startup script
  for interpreted version.

* Made improvements in the editing of local catalogs. Clicking on a
  catalog symbol updates the edit window, if it is displayed.

---------------  07.7.98 released skycat-2.0.18 --------------------------

* SkySearch.tcl: Fixed minor debugging problem: propagate -debug flag
  to AstroQuery.tcl.

---------------  26.6.98 released skycat-2.0.17 --------------------------

* Skycat, single binary version: Added check for correct prolog.ps file
  in ~/.skycat dir (many users have an outdated version of this file
  in the ~/.skycat dir, created by an earlier skycat release).

---------------  19.6.98 released skycat-2.0.16 --------------------------

* skycat/et/library/psprolog.tcl: added a Tcl script to run at startup
  in the single binary version, to create the Tk prolog.ps file in
  ~/.skycat. This is needed after changes in the RtdImage print class
  for printing images and graphics as postscript, using a Tk extension
  for that in the tclutil package.

---------------  28.5.98 released skycat-2.0.15 --------------------------

* Implemented skycat "symbol" subcommand for drawing symbols.
  and added SkyCatCtrl::draw_symbol again (was removed from previous
  version). See skycat/interp/src/Skycat.C and man page Skycat.man3.

---------------  13.5.98 released skycat-2.0.14 --------------------------

* SkyCat.tcl: remote interface proc: pick_object: fixed a minor bug
  that reported an unknown Tcl variable.

---------------  4.5.98 released skycat-2.0.13 ------------------------------

* Skycat.C: Fixed a recently introduced bug in coordinate conversion
  that caused problems plotting catalog symbols for images with 
  equinox != 2000 (The equinox was previously not taken into account).

* SkyCat.tcl: Cleaned up the handling of the skycat_images list to remove
  windows when they are closed.

* SkySearch.tcl: plotting symbols with no image: changed to not always
  generate a new blank image, but allow plotting multiple catalogs on one
  blank image.

* SkySearch.C: Minor change in handling of equinox to default to
  "2000" for galactic or ecliptic coords.

---------------  28.4.98 released skycat-2.0.12 ------------------------------

* library/Skycat.tcl: Minor change to "usage" message,
  demos/skycat.tcl: check for "-help" option.

* The single binary version of skycat is now linked with the shared X
  libraries. This is necessary in order to be able to dynamically load
  shared libraries for skycat plugins at runtime. If this causes any
  problems, check out ftp://ftp.archive.eso.org/pub/skycat/, where
  we will provide tar files with the necessary libraries. 

---------------  15.4.98 released skycat-2.0.11 ------------------------------

* (doc, *.tcl): For documenting the "public interface": Updated
  comments on all Itk component declarations and added "public",
  "private" and "protected" keywords in the source to help identify
  the public interface, which is documented in man pages generated
  from the source by the itcldoc utility (tclutil package).

* Minor changes in configure script and top level makefile for shared
  libraries

--------------- 31.03.98 released skycat 2.0.10 -----------------------

* Updated man pages and documentation

--------------- 25.03.98 released skycat 2.0.9 -----------------------

* Made minor changes in the C++ class Skycat, to make it easier to
  derive a subclass with its own configuration options (Added 2
  optional arguments to constructor), defined SKYCAT_OPTIONS macro,
  so that derived classes can add new options.

* SkyCat.tcl: changed clone method (Menu: "New Window") to not reload 
  the original image again.

* Added "clone" number to window headers, to help identify related windows
  when there is more than one main window. Note: The Tk path name of the
  main skycat window is now ".skycat1", however the name should never
  be hard coded. Use the SkyCat member proc "get_skycat_images" to get
  a list of main window path names.

--------------- 05.03.98 released skycat 2.0.8 -----------------------

* Added a -remote option to skycat: usage: "skycat -remote 1 file ..."
  When "-remote 1" is specified and a skycat application is already
  running on the same display, the existing skycat application opens a
  new main window to display the image. In this way, you only need to
  have one skycat application running at a time, which saves memory
  and colors in the colormap. Note that this feature uses "Tcl send",
  which has a special X security check and so won't work if you use
  the "XHOST" style X security. Unless X security is disabled in the
  binary, you need to use XAUTH style security. See the "Tcl/Tk Tools"
  book for a good explanation of this.

* Catalog/Image display: Fixed problems connecting the correct line
  numbers with the correct symbols after filtering out symbols.

* Removed direct dependency on astrotcl and tclutil packages (these
  packages are now initialized automatically by the Rtd and Cat
  packages).

* Made it possible to "select" a catalog symbol in the image, even if
  it is hidden by another symbol on top of it. If one symbol is hidden
  behind another, just click again to select it. You can "cycle"
  through a stack of symbols by clicking multiple times. Use
  <Control>-1 to toggle the selection of a symbol.

* Added a "Filter" button to the catalog display widget
  (SkySearch.tcl) to filter out objects that are not visible in the
  query result list.  This is needed because the query is circular,
  while the image is rectangular, leaving some objects in the listing
  that can not be plotted in the image.

* Added a new command line option: "-catalog $catalogName". Now you
  can have a catalog window (local or other) opened automatically
  when skycat starts. i.e.: "skycat file.fits -catalog file.cat".

* Removed Tcl versions of symbol drawing procs that are now implemented
  in C++.

--------------- 13.2.98 released skycat 2.0.7 -----------------------

* Moved the catalog symbol plot method from Tcl to C++ to improve the
  speed of plotting 1000's of objects on large images.  (In one test,
  the time required to plot a large catalog was reduced from about 60
  secs to about 3 seconds).

* The C++ class "Skycat" is now a subclass of the RtdImage class and
  uses RtdImage methods to help implement symbol drawing routines.

* Added new C++ class "SkySearch", which is a subclass of
  "TclAstroCat", the class that implements the "astrocat" Tcl
  command. The new class adds the "plot" subcommand to the "astrocat"
  command, which replaces the previous Itcl version to plot symbols
  faster.

* Optimized the canvas bindings for catalog symbols so that the
  bindings are only made once fo all objects, rather than once for
  each object.

* Removed the "unexec" directories (replaced by "et" - Embedded Tk).
  The "unexec" code was previously used to create a single binary and
  has been replaced by "et" now.

--------------- 9.2.98 released skycat 2.0.6 -----------------------

* Fixed problems with the size and location of plot symbols 
  (The fix is actually in the astrotcl package)

* Made the C++ Skycat class a subclass of RtdImage, so that it is
  easy to add new rtdimage subcommands there.

--------------- 3.2.98 released skycat 2.0.5 -----------------------

* Added selection of a region of objects on the image. All objects
  in the region are selected.

* Improved selection of catalog plot symbols in the image and listbox.
  Plot symbols are now selected in the image with mouse button 1.
  If the shift or control key are also down, multiple objects may be
  selected. Objects may be selected in either the image window or
  the table listing, with the same effect. The selected objects may be
  added to a local catalog, etc...

* Added 2 procs, "dtohms" and "hmstod", for converting between
  hh:mm:ss and floating point values. These are designed to be used in
  the plot symbol expressions.  For example: [expr [hmstod $ra]*15.]
  returns ra in degrees, while [dtohms [expr $ra_deg/15.]] converts
  ra_deg from floating point degrees to hh:mm:ss format.

--------------- 26.01.98 released skycat 2.0.4 ---------------------

* Updated comments in Itcl sources for automatic generation of man pages.
  (There are now man pages for all Itcl classes).

* Added framemaker docs for skycat package.
  (see ftp://ftp.archive.eso.org/pub/skycat/doc/skycat.ps.gz)

* Moved image related code from the cat package to skycat and added
  subclasses of the cat widgets to add image and plotting support.

* Added support for Tcl plugins 
  (see ftp://ftp.archive.eso.org/pub/skycat/doc/skycat.ps.gz)
  and an example plugin to save and reload line graphics 
  (see skycat/demos/SkyCat_plugin.tcl).

  The example plugin for Skycat adds support for saving line graphics
  to a file in image or world coordinates and reloading it again. Whe
  you reload the graphics, you can specify if they should be "sticky"
  and remain after a new image is loaded.

--------------- released skycat 2.0.2 ------------------------------

* Replaced "unexec" package with "ET" (Embedded Tk), for creating a
  single binary of skycat, including Tcl sources and colormaps, etc.
  (The unexec version is still included, but not used by default).

* Reorganized sources to include 2 new packages: 

  The new package Tclutil was created by gathering "generic" Tcl and
  C++ code from various applications into a single generic Tcl
  package.  

  The new package "Astrotcl" was created by gathering general
  astronomy related Tcl and C++ code from other packages into a
  single, reusable package.

* Moved catalog widgets to the Cat package.

* changes in catalog library and skycat user interface: 

  - There is a new catalog menu layout.

  - Added a new popup window for displaying and browsing the catalog
    directory tree. You can select catalogs from various catalog servers
    and save them in your own personal config file. The changes appear
    immediately in the catalog menu.

  - Added a menu item to reload the catalog config file after you have
    edited it by hand.

  - The layout of the catalog window is now dependent on the 
    information in the catalog config file (search columns).

  - Added support for editing the catalog config file. There are now
    menu items for setting the sort columns and sort order, search
    columns, column display order, columns to show or hide, plot symbol
    info (see the "Options" menu - changes are automatically saved in
    ~/.skycat/skycat.cfg)

  - Added more support for plot symbols: Now you can configure the
    color, shape, angle, size and units of the symbols to be displayed
    in the image for a star or other object. There is a window interface
    for editing the settings (see the Options menu).

--------------- 30 Apr 97 released skycat 1.1 ------------------------

* Ported to itcl2.2, tcl7.6, tk4.2, blt2.1,...

* Added support for shared libs and loadable modules

--------------- 30 Dec 97 released skycat 1.0.5 ----------------------

* (skycat): The default catalog/archive/image server is now taken as
  the first one in the config file and no longer hard coded to names
  such as "Guide Star Catalog at ESO".

* added "-dhshost" option to skycat, which enables the OLAF menu.
  When you "Subscribe to DHS", a subprocess (rtdSubscribe) is started
  to communicate with the DHS via IMP messages. The subprocess 
  communicates with skycat via the socket interface.

--------------- 14 Nov 96 released skycat 1.0.2 ----------------------

* made minor changes to Makefiles and tcl scripts to allow Skycat
  to be released as a package separate from rtd and catlib. Now you
  can install rtd and catlib first and then get the "skycat-exclude..."
  tarfile from the ftp site, which doesn't include rtd and cat.
  I still prefer to release the whole thing together to make sure the
  versions match...

--------------- 8 Nov 96 released skycat 1.0.1 ----------------------

* added item to the user interface to display the copyright info for
  the current catalog or image server.

--------------- 7 Nov 96 released skycat 1.0 ----------------------

--------------- 23 Oct 96 released skycat 1.0b16 ----------------------

* (skycat) fixed the single binary problem related to the tclEnv patch
  (see below), since the original fix did not work. The tclEnv patch is 
  still the same.

--------------- 22 Oct 96 released skycat 1.0b15 ----------------------

* (skycat) fixd a problem that only showed up in the single binary 
  version of skycat: under certain circumstances, skycat would
  crash immediately on start up. I had to patch a a Tcl source file
  (tclEnv.c) to fix this.
  The patch is in the patches dir in the release and is only needed if
  you compile the single binary version of skycat (there are 2 other
  patches that already needed to be applied to the Tcl sources, this
  just adds one more...)

* in AstroCat.tcl: add confirmation dialogs for entering, updating and
  deleting local catalog entries.

* (catlib) The catalog config file entry is now written to local catalogs 
  (in the header) so that the same plot symbol is used when the file is reloaded.

--------------- 1 Oct 96 released skycat 1.0 ------------------

* (rtd) loading large files should be faster now, due to use of mmap
  in place of reading the file.

* AstroCat.tcl: plotting of search results on a blank image now works again 
  (typo in "catch" stmt caused it to be ignored in previous version).

--------------- 20 Sep 96 released skycat 1.0b11 ------------------

See also ../rtd/CHANGES for changes in the image display and user interface
and ../cat/CHANGES for changes dealing with catalogs.

* fixed handling of HTTP error messages that come in HTML format
  (in the previous version, the text of the error message was sometimes lost)

* split the "./cat" directory into "./cat" (catalog libraries only) and "./skycat"
  (skycat application, interpreted and single binary versions), by request.

  The old "cat/tclcat" directory is now called "skycat/interp" and holds the
  interpreted version of skycat (skycat_wish, tcl/tk sources, etc.).

  The "skycat/unexec" dir holds the single binary version, created with the
  GNU emacs "unexec" routine.

  Note that skycat "depends" on these other modules: rtd (real-time display),
  cat (catalog libs), unexec (GNU emacs unexec routines for various systems).

---------------- 14 Aug 96 released skycat-1.0b10 ------------------

* skycat remote Tk send interface: 
	fixed widget names used (were out of date)

  	added interface for "pick object" to select an object/star and return 
 	the coordinates, FWHM, etc.

  (only available via send, need to add something for socket interface?)

  These procs are available via Tk send:

	get_catalog_info {} 
		- return contents of catalog listing in the format
		{{selected_row} {{row1} {row2} ...}}

  	display_image {ra dec width height {equinox 2000}} 
		- display image from DSS

	mark_image {ra dec width height} 
		- draw a rectangle on the image, return id

	unmark_image {id} 
		- remove the rectangle given by id

	load_image {filename} 
		- load and display an image file
	
	pick_object {{cmd ""}} 
		- display the "PickObject" dialog window to allow the user to select
		  an object/star and return the info for it in the form:
 		  {$x $y $ra $dec $equinox $fwhmX $fwhmY $angle $object $background}
	
  See also the comments at end of source file:  cat/tclcat/library/SkyCat.tcl.
  The PickObject interface is (or will be) described in the man page RtdImagePick(n).
				
* Local Catalogs: fixed bug when editing entry in local catalog: 
  (if you didn't change the id, it didn't show up). 
  Added range checks for RA and DEC (and all TCS columns).

    Note that editing of local catalogs still needs some work. The
    current implementation should be viewed as the first prototype. I
    plan to change the code to keep the local catalog in memory as
    when editing files and save the changes when ready.  Currently all
    operations are performed on the file, with no undo. I was assuming
    the local catalog files might be too large to keep in memory...
    We should look into various public domain solutions (poor man's
    databases, etc.).

* Skycat now creates the directory ~/.skycat, which it uses for some temporary
  files and log files. The file ~/.skycat/log contains the URLs last sent to
  a catalog server. This can be usefull for debugging. In a future release, this
  directory will also contain a "preferences" file with skycat defaults.

---------------- 6 Aug 96 released skycat-1.0b9  ------------------

* added decompression algorithms (H-compress, gzip, unix) the PREVIEW
  field in catalog query results is now interpreted as an image OR a tab
  table to plot, based on the "Content-type" field of the preview data
  returned.
  The current implementation is based on the document:
      http://arch-http.hq.eso.org/~amicol/asu_94.html
  If the "Content-type" of the preview is recognized, it is plotted as
  a graph or loaded as an image...


* added new itcl class "PreviewPlot" for viewing catalog preview data,
  creates new window for each plot.

* added way to include a single '%' in the skycat config file (use "%%")

---------------- 1 Aug 96 released skycat-1.0b8  ------------------

* Added an interface for selecting an object/star in the image
  and calculating the center, FWHM and angle
  (see View menu, "Pick object")

* In the single binary vesion of skycat, the "prolog.ps" file
  is no longer needed for printing (it is stored in memory).

* Local TCS catalogs are now recognized as TCS catalogs when
  they are loaded. When they are stored, a table header describing
  the columns is also stored at the top of the file.

* Fixed problems with world coordinates where (hour == -0.0).
  (0:0:1 -0:0:1) should work correctly now.

---------------- 24 Jul 96 released skycat-1.0b6  ------------------

* The main new additions are support for TCS catalogs and
  local catalogs, as well as various bug fixes.

---------------- 28 May 96 released skycat-1.0a10  ------------------
 
* The main visible changes are some new menu items and support
  for a private colormap...  

---------------- 23 May 96 released skycat-1.0a9  ------------------

* private colormaps are used when there are not enough
  colors. The default minimum amount of colors is 30 and
  the default max is 60. You can set these via the -min_color
  and -max_color options.  If min_colors colors are not found,
  a private colormap is installed. I tried to save the GUI
  colors to avoid flashing...

* There is a new menu item under File for "cloning" the main
  window. The main windows share the same colors, but otherwise
  are like 2 different applications.

* I added a menu item to the View menu to hide/show the popup
   windows.

---------------- 12 Apr 96 released skycat-1.0a8  ------------------

* simbad names with blanks are now handled correctly

* negative world coordinates are now handled correctly

* bzero and bscale Fits keywords are now used

---------------- 6 Feb 96 released skycat-1.0a2  ------------------

* lots of bug fixes

* added a fancy logo that Miguel created

* added a netscape-like progress bar

* added a menu item for viewing the FITS header

* better option processing: you can now do this:
	% skycat file.fits &
  or this:
 	% cat file.fits | skycat -

  Usage: skycat ?fitsFile? ?-option value ...?
 
   Options:
        -file <file>                - fits file to load ('-' for stdin)
        -archive <1|0>              - include ESO/Archive extensions (default)
        -vlt <1|0>                  - include ESO/VLT Real-Time Features
        -default_cmap <cmap>        - default colormap
        -default_itt <itt>          - default intensity transfer table
        -colorramp_height <pixels>  - height of color bar
        -with_colorramp <1|0>       - display the color bar (default)
        -with_zoom_window <1|0>     - display the zoom window (default))
        -with_pan_window <1|0>      - display the pan window (default))
        -dozoom <1|0>               - turn on zoom window (default)
        -debug <1|0>                - debug flag: run bg processes in fg
        -usexshm <1|0>              - use X shared mem, if available (default)
        -verbose <1|0>              - print diagnostic messages

* You can now specify different plot symbols in the skycat config
  file (see http://arch-http.hq.eso.org/skycat/skycat.cfg). 
  square, circle, triangle, cross, plus and diamond are implemented.

* You can now plot objects (GSC, for example) on a blank screen
  (A dummy image is generated with the given world coordinates)

* You can also use DSS when no image is loaded.

---------------- 25 Feb 96 released skycat-1.0a1  ------------------

* Added versions for Solaris (with shared libs) and HP

* Each catalog now gets a separate window 

* The links between the catalog listing and the plotted
  objects should work correctly now (currently GSC and NED 
  are set up to use this)

* Double-clicking on an object (GSC or NED, for example) inserts
  the object's Id in the image next to the object.
  You can edit the label, change its color, font, position, etc...

* added tcl classes and commands: astrocat, astroimage and some
  Itcl user interface windows for them for GSC and DSS

* made separate catalog package (cat), complete with configure
  script and demo, to keep separate from, but built on top of RTD

* added classes and test cases for WCS, DSS, GSC

----------- Sep 18, 1995: Started on Skycat and catalog libs  ----------
