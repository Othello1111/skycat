Skycat Package
--------------

This directory contains the sources for Skycat, a tool that combines
visualization of images and access to catalogs and archive data for
astronomy.

Skycat is based on the ESO Real-Time Display package (rtd) and the ESO
Catalog library package (cat).  These should already be installed, or
compiled in the ../rtd and ../cat directories.

-------------------------------------------

For installation instructions, see the file INSTALL in this directory.

See the CHANGES file in this directory for a list of recent changes.

This module consists of the following parts:

* The C++ sources and [incr Tcl] widget classes for Skycat.  These are
  also available as a Tcl "package" called "Skycat" and so can be
  dynamically loaded in another application.

* The "interp" directory builds the "interpreted" version of
  Skycat. This is an extended "wish" binary with the Rtd and Catalog
  extensions included.

For Tcl7.6/Tk4.2 only:

* The "et" directory is used to create a standalone single binary
  version of skycat using ET ("Embedded Tk"). ET uses a preprocessor
  to "include" Tcl/Tk scripts in a C or C++ application at compile
  time.

For Tcl8.0.3/Tk8.0.3 or newer:

* The "tclpro" directory is used to create a standalone single binary
  version of Skycat using the Scriptics TclPro "prowrap" application.
  See http://www.scriptics.com/tclpro/ for more information and a free
  30 day trial version.


Requirements
------------

The following packages (normally included in the tarfile) should be
either already installed or compiled under the parent directory (i.e.:
all of the source packages should be under a common parent directory):

* rtd       Real-Time Display 

* cat       Catalog Library 

* astrotcl  Astronomical software utilities

* tclutil   General utility package

See the INSTALL file for details on compiling and installing the
skycat package.


Running
-------

Once compiled and installed, the skycat application may be started in
the following ways:

The interpreted version (requires Tcl source files at run time):
	
	$INSTALLDIR/bin/skycat
 
The single binary version has the OS version appended to the name, for
example skycat-SunOS-5.5.1 and does not require any special Tcl
run-time environment:

 	$INSTALLDIR/bin/skycat-$OSVERSION

($OSVERSION is defined as "`uname -s`-`uname -r`")


Environment Variables:
----------------------

You may specify a URL for the default catalog config file by defining
the following environment variable:
	
	setenv SKYCAT_CONFIG http://archive.eso.org/skycat/skycat.cfg

The catalog config file contains a description of the available
catalogs and defines how to access them via HTTP. The default is the
URL shown above. If the file "~/.skycat/skycat.cfg" is found, it is
used instead. This file may be edited by hand or using the Skycat
catalog directory browser (Skycat saves changes to the catalog list to
this file automatically).


Documentation
-------------

The latest documentation (in postscript, FrameMaker, and PDF formats)
is available under:

	ftp://ftp.archive.eso.org/pub/skycat/doc

An HTML version is also available from:

	http://arcdev.hq.eso.org/~archeso/skycat/skycat-man.html

The Skycat application is based on the following packages:

* Tclutil (Tcl and C++ Utilities)

* Astrotcl (Astronomical Tcl and C++ Utilities)

* Rtd (Real-Time Display) 

* Cat (Catalog library) 

* Skycat (The ESO Skycat Tool)

See the documentation for the above packages for more information.
