* graphics_features
  
    This directory contains some simple Tcl scripts that add a menu item
    to the Skycat "Graphics" menu for saving and reloading line
    graphics, optionally based on world coordinates and also with a
    "sticky" option that keeps the graphics around after a new image
    has been loaded.
