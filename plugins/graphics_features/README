Skycat Plugin Examples
======================

This directory contains the Tcl sources for an example skycat plugin
that adds the ability to save line graphics to a file in world or
image coordinates and reload them again.

To use this file for skycat, set the environment variable
SKYCAT_PLUGIN to the path name of the SkyCat_plugin.tcl file.

This file defines one tcl proc: SkyCat_plugin, which takes one
argument: the name of the top level skycat widget.

See the skycat documentation for details.
