RTD, A Real-Time Display Widget for Tk

from shared memory or files.

For installation instructions, see the file INSTALL in this directory.

See the CHANGES file in this directory for a list of recent changes.

Note: The RTD software has been tested on HP-UX, Solaris and Linux
with gcc 2.7.2.x.

Once everything has been compiled, the rtd application may be started
as follows:

	% cd $SRCDIR/rtdimg/demos
	% rtd 

Or, for the installed version:
	
	% $INSTALLDIR/bin/rtd 
	
You can specify a FITS file to view by specifying a filename on the
command line, or by selecting "Open" from the "File" menu when the
application comes up.

Note: if you want to run the demo from a machine other than the one
you compiled it on, you may need to set the RTD_LIBRARY environment
variable so that the necessary Tcl source files can be found at run
time:

	% setenv RTD_LIBRARY $INSTALLDIR/lib/rtd

For more information, please refer to the postscript documentation,
which can be retrieved via anon ftp from:

   ftp://ftp.archive.eso.org/pub/skycat/doc 

The sources for the man pages can be found in the source tree under
the "man" directories.
