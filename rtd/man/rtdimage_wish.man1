NAME
rtdimage_wish - a Tk wish shell with the rtdimage extension

SYNOPSIS
rtdimage_wish ?fileName arg arg ...?

DESCRIPTION
rtdimage_wish is the Tk wish shell created by the RTD package
to demonstrate the real-time display widget features.  This
version of wish(1) contains, in addition to the rtdimage
extension, the BLT, [incr Tk] and TclX extensions. BLT is
required for displaying graphs and tables, [incr Tk] is used
for its class system and TclX is used for various utility
commands and interprocess communication (rtdServer(1).

ADDING THE RTDIMAGE EXTENSION
The rtdimage extension can be included in a Tk application
shell in the standard way, by adding a call to
RtdImage_Init(interp) in the Tcl_AppInit() routine, which
every Tk application must define:

/* initialize the rtdimage type */
if (RtdImage_Init(interp) == TCL_ERROR) {
    return TCL_ERROR;
}

Note that since the rtdimage extension is implemented in C++,
it is required that main() also be compile with C++. Normally,
main() is included in the same C file with Tcl_AppInit(), so
you have 2 choices: you can rename the file tkAppInit.c to
tkAppInit.C and compile and link it with a C++ compiler, or
you can put main() in a separate file and compile and link it
with a C++ compiler.
