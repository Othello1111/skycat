CHANGES to Tclutil
-----------------

This file contains a list of changes to the Tclutil software.
The latest changes are at the top.

--------------- 03.02.06 released tclutil-2.0 -------------------

* Major update: see top level CHANGES file.

--------------- 04.04.05 released tclutil-1.2.8 -----------------

* workaround bug in tcl 8.4.3 (SourceForge Request ID 835020)

* Updated configure.in for APR2004 (tcl8.4, itcl3.3)

* Generally 'using namespace std' instead of specifying ::std

* Made the menu toolbar a bit smaller (it's planned to add an icon toolbar
  underneath the menu toolbar.

--------------- 20.01.03 released tclutil-1.2.5 -----------------

* Ported to gcc-3.2.1 and Tcl-8.4.1

--------------- 27.08.01 released tclutil-1.2.4 -----------------

* Merged in minor changes from Peter Biereichel (added some #include files).

--------------- 18.05.01 released tclutil-1.2.3 -----------------

* Ported to tcl8.3.3 (still compatible with earlier versions).

--------------- 09.11.00 released tclutil-1.2.3  -----------------

* Fixed a bug that occurred when attempting to memory map a file that
  was a relative path to a relative symbolic link. 
  (For example: Mem("../x.fits"), where x.fits is a link to y.fits).
  The util/Mem class previously tried to resolve symbolic links, but didn't
  get it right in this one case. The new version does not try to
  resolve the links (commented out the call to fileRealname()).

--------------- 02.03.00 released tclutil-1.2.2  -----------------

* Added an optional argument to TopLevelWidget::start to specify the
  valid options for an application. This was as a workaround to
  what may be a bug in Tcl or Itcl that caused the application
  to crash when an unknown argument was given.

---------------  14.12.99 released tclutil-1.2.1 ------------------

* Merged in changes made by Peter Biereichel (see below):

* Mem.C: use _exit() in the signal handler to avoid that the message queue
  of a possible parent process (see Batch.tcl) is closed.

* Mem.C: attach to shm with SHM_RDONLY when owner=0

---------------  25.10.99 released tclutil-1.2 --------------------

* Merged in changes made by Peter Biereichel

---------------  09.09.99 released tclutil-1.1.5 ------------------------

* Updated for egcs/gcc-2.95 (This compiler version is stricter
  for C++ code and even fails the solaris X11 header files, unless
  told to ignore the errors...). Added check in configure.in
  for solaris and gcc-2.95*, to include the -fpermissive flag with g++.

---------------  21.06.99 released tclutil-1.1.4 ------------------------

* FileSelect.tcl: changed listbox bindings from <1> to <ButtonRelease-1>
  to avoid conflict with default bindings.

---------------  01.04.99 released tclutil-1.1.3 ------------------------

* Replaced sys_errlist[] with strerror() in error.C to get around
  porting problems.

* changed tclsh$vers to itclsh$vers in tix/src/Makefile.in, since
  tclsh was often not found.

* Added workaround in configure.in to tcl8.0.5 configure script
  bug dealing with HP-UX machines and the TCL_SHLIB_LD variable
  defined in tclConfig.sh (was set wrong for HP).

---------------  22.03.99 released tclutil-1.1.2 ------------------------

* Replaced itclsh2.2 with itclsh@ITCL_VERSION@ in Makefile.in.

* EntryForm.tcl: added scrollbars to make it easier to view many
  entries.

* Changed "quit" method in TopLevelWidget to use "delete object $this"
  instead of "destroy $w_".

* Removed lib -lieee from configure.in, since it caused problems with 
  shared libraries later on in the gaia plugin.

* error.C: removed "#include errno.h" to avoid problems with new
  linux versions.

* configure.in: removed -lieee library from configure script, since
  it caused linking problems on glibc linux versions.

* updated local copies of tcl headers for the local tix package
  for tcl8.0.5.

* Merged in changes from Peter W. Draper (Starlink) to support 16 and
  24 bit color.

* Added routine Tk_CanvasWindowCoordsNoClip() in tkCanvasImagePs.c to
  work around Tk's limit on canvas coordinates to short range. Now
  the canvas coordinates do not have to be clipped to short range.

* bltGraph.tcl: Added patch for blt2.4g from Peter Draper.

---------------  28.12.98 released tclutil-1.1.1 ------------------------

* Minor change in udialog.tcl to avoid multiple error message problems.

* Added an optional argument to Mem::remap() to allow increasing the
  size of an mmapped file.

* Fixed mistaken "//" comments in Blt_GraphElement.c.

* Rebuild tclIndex file whenever configure is run, since Tcl8 version
  is not compatible with tcl7 version (see makelinks script).

* tkCanvasPsImage.c: changed "unsigned int" to "int" to avoid sunpro
  cc warning.

---------------  16.11.98 released tclutil-1.1 ------------------------

* Ported to tcl8.0.3 (still compatible with tcl7.6):

  - Changed the syntax used for the namespace and scope commands in
    tcl8.

  - Itcl member procs in the "util" namespace now need to be called
    with "util::" prefix. For example: "util::TopLevelWidget::start ..."

  - Updated the BLT related code to work with both BLT2.1 and 2.4f.

  - Updated the configure scripts to handle Tcl8.0 and Tcl7.6.

---------------  30.8.98 released tclutil-1.0.17 -----------------------

* Added a "wait" command in Batch.tcl to reap background processes
  and avoid zombies.

---------------  5.8.98 released tclutil-1.0.16 -----------------------

* Added authorization support to class HTTP. The class now recognizes
  the "Authorization Required" message returned from an HTTP server
  and provides a method "authorize(username, passwd)" for clients to
  set user and password information. The information is optionally
  saved in a file (by default: ~/.http_auth), indexed by server
  host name and realm and with the username and password encoded.

* Added new public methods to class HTTP: content_encoding(),
  www_auth_realm(), authorizationRequired(), authorize(), authFile(),
  userAgent(), and changed html_error() from a "static" to nonstatic
  member.

* Added new Itcl dialog class: PasswdDialog, and new proc that uses
  it: passwd_dialog.

* Added the X11 library directory to shared lib path in startup script

* Changed DialogWidget itcl class to use a label in place of a message
  and truncate lines from long messages.

* Fixed minor bug in TopLevelWidget that prevented the code from
  remembering the locations of top level widgets. Now, if you place a
  window somewhere, it comes up there the next time the window is
  created in that session.

---------------  07.07.98 released tclutil-1.0.15 -----------------------

* class HTTP: added suport for HTTP POST: new methods: HTTP::post(url,
  data) and HTTP::post(url, data, ostream).

---------------  26.6.98 released tclutil-1.0.14 -----------------------

* Added support for HTTP proxy servers (thanks to Peter Draper for
  implementing this).  The proxy server, if available, is defined by
  the "http_proxy" environment variable. This should have the format:

    http_proxy = "http://wwwcache.some.domain:port/"

  A list of domains that do not require to be proxied (i.e. local
  machines etc.) is defined by the variable "http_noproxy". This
  should be a list of comma separated names, i.e.:

    http_noproxy = "local.domain,national.domain"

  If the given host is in one of these domains no proxy will be set
  up.

* Mem.C: added checks for file permissions to avoid problems with mmap
  and read-only files (or files with no read permission).

---------------  19.6.98 released tclutil-1.0.13 -----------------------

* HTTP.C: fixed a minor bug that cut off last char of an HTTP error
  message

* Added new file: tclutil/src/tkCanvasPsImage.c, which implements Tk
  canvas postscript printing for images. The default Tk canvas
  postscript command does not support printing images and the
  available patch could not handle large, zoomed in images. This
  version does not require a patch to Tk. The extension is based on
  the patch, with fixes provided by Peter Draper of Starlink, and is
  activated optionally by calling the C routine TkCanvasPsImage_Init().
 
---------------  28.5.98 released tclutil-1.0.12 -----------------------

* Added support for HTTP redirect "Location: ..." to HTTP class

* HTTP.C: check for HTTP header info in URL command output.  If a URL
  is a command (not "file:/..." or "http:/...") its output may have an
  optional HTTP type header containing lines such as "Content-type:
  ...", "Content-length: ...", etc. (at most 5 lines).  If these lines
  are found, they are noted and skipped over before accessing the
  data.

* Minor bug fix in TclCommand.C, for case when interp->result is appended
  to itself.

---------------  13.5.98 released tclutil-1.0.11 -----------------------
-
* FileSelect.tcl: added missing method (set_filter_type)

* EntryForm.tcl: destroy window on "Enter" as well as "Cancel"
  (previously, "Cancel" destroyed the window, but "Enter" only closed it).

---------------  4.5.98 released tclutil-1.0.10 -------------------------

* CanvasDraw.tcl: Changed protection on "create_done" to public

---------------  28.4.98 released tclutil-1.0.9 -------------------------

* Minor addition to TopLevelWidget error handling (in start_err_,
  allow --help option to print "usage" message).

---------------  15.4.98 released tclutil-1.0.8 -------------------------

* itcldoc.tcl (automatic man page generation from Itcl classes)

  - Added code to extract information from Itcl classes about the Itk
    components and component options.

  - Added code to document "public" and "protected" methods and
    variables.

* (doc, *.tcl): For documenting the "public interface": Updated
  comments on all Itk component declarations and added "public",
  "private" and "protected" keywords in the source to help identify
  the public interface, which is documented in man pages generated
  from the source by the itcldoc utility in this package.

* Minor changes in configure script and top level makefile for shared
  libraries

* Fixed a last minute problem with calling plugin procs (needed to use
  "uplevel #0" due to Itcl scoping/namespace hell...).

-----------------  31.03.98 released tclutil-1.0.7 ----------------------

* Updated man pages and documentation

-----------------  25.03.98 released tclutil-1.0.6 ----------------------

* Minor change in class ShellCommand (kill child process on error).

* added "more_error" method to TclCommand, to append an error message.

* TkImage constructor: changed options arg from reference to pointer
  for consistency with usage.

* TopLevelWidget.tcl: Added support for a simple help window to
  TopLevelWidget, and added two new widgets: HelpWin and ScrolledText
  (contributed by Peter Draper, Starlink).

* CanvasDraw.tcl: 
   * Make use of "init" method in CanvasDraw constructor (easier for
     subclassing).
   * Added -clipping option to control clipping of graphics (default
     is the same as before).

* TopLevelWidget.tcl: Added "-underline" option to add_menubutton, to
  allow proper keyboard traversal.

* Tix library: commented out global bindings (grep for "bind all" in 
  tix/library dir), since they interfere with Tk keyboard traversal
  in menus, etc.

* TopLevelWidget: fixed bug in method "list_windows" so that it lists
  all top level windows (previously not all windows were listed).

* TopLevelWidget: added "-number" option to keep track of cloned windows.
  This is a number that can be put in the window title to identify which
  main window a popup window belongs to. By default the number is set
  automatically set from the widget path name by looking for a name, such
  as ".<appname><number>...", for example: .app1, .app2, ...

* LabelEntryScale.tcl: added fixes from Peter Fraper, Starlink, to support
  vertical and horizontal layout and keybindings and improve performance.

-----------------  05.03.98 released tclutil-1.0.5 -------------------------

* fixed minor problems setting and restoring the mouse cursor
* (CanvasDraw).

* For backward compatibility with existing applications: The Tclutil
  package now contains the sources for the Tix widget set. Tix support
  can be included in an application by calling Tixsam_Init(interp) and
  linking -ltclutil (or the necessary object files from this package).
  This has no effect on packages that do not use Tix. 
  
* Implemented rotation for canvas graphics. Since Tk doesn't support
  this directly, it is done now in Tcl code. Polygons are now used
  in place of rectangles, to make it posible to rotate a rectangle.
  (The appearance and funtionality is the same). You still can't
  rotate ovals, but you can rotate a smooth rectangle, which is
  similar (see below).

* Added a "Smooth" option in the graphics window (CanvasDraw), so you 
  can make smooth (rounded) rectangles, polygons or polylines. 

* Changed the selection mechanism, so that the graphics window always
  displays the options for the currently selected object.

* Plugins: The <CLASSNAME>_PLUGIN environment variable may now contain
  a colon separated list of plugin files or directories containing
  plugin files.  This way you can have multiple plugins for a
  class. For a top level class Foo, for example, the environment
  variable FOO_PLUGIN may contain a colon separated list of plugin
  files or directories containing plugin files. The default file name,
  if only a directory name is given, is then Foo_plugin.tcl, which
  defines the Tcl proc Foo_plugin.
   
----------------- 13.2.98 released tclutil-1.0.4 -------------------------

* Added 2 methods to TopLevelWidget: list_windows and hide_windows
  to add support for toggling the visibility of all popup windows 
  other than the main one.

-----------------  9.2.98 released tclutil-1.0.3 -------------------------

* Added "const" to "cmdname" arg in constructor for TclCommandand
  TkImage classes.

* Added (void*) cast to MAP_FAILED constant in class Mem_Map

* Fixed minor bugs in bltGraph.tcl (used for zooming in a graph)

* added check for "gethostname" prototype to configure script.

----------------- 3.2.98 released tclutil-1.0.2 -------------------------

* In class CanvasDraw, added support for selecting a region of objects,
  and moving a group of objects. Added region icon to drawing mode
  frame.

* Added methods "append_result", "append_element", "reset_result"
  in class TclCommand.

--------------- 26.01.98 released tclutil-1.0.1 -------------------------

* Added plugin support to the TopLevelWidget class, so all classes
  derived from it can have Tcl plugins (see docs).

* Added a script tclutil/demos/itcldoc that extracts man pages from
  Itcl class sources automatically, with no special syntax needed in
  the comments. The script simply assumes that comments precede
  declarations.  Since Itcl sources have a simple Tcl list format, it
  is fairly easy to parse them. The only requirement is that each
  class, method and other important declarations are preceded by a
  "block" comment (a group of lines starting with "#"). To run the
  script, cd to the dir containing the tcl source files (here
  tclutil/library) and type: "make doc".

* Updated comments in Itcl sources for automatic generation of man
  pages.

* Renamed some source files to have the same name as the class
  (TList.tcl ==> TableList.tcl, Dialog.tcl ==> DialogWidget.tcl, ...)

--------------- released tclutil-1.0 ------------------------------------

* Created new package Tclutil by gathering "generic" Tcl and C++ code
  from various applications into a single generic Tcl package.  The
  Tclutil package contains a collection of handy Itcl and C++ utility
  classes and also provides a shell script (TclutilConfig.sh), created
  by configure, that makes it easier to write configure scripts for
  other packages. This package assumes the development environment
  includes C++, Itcl, TclX, BLT and optionally other packages that can
  be linked in statically or dynamically as needed.
