Tclutil, Generic Tcl/Tk and C++ Utilities and Classes
-----------------------------------------------------

The Tclutil package was created by gathering generic Tcl, Itcl and C++
code from various applications into a single, general purpose, utility
package, that can be loaded dynamically into a running Tcl application
or linked in at compile time as a general purpose library.

The package contains a collection of useful Itcl and C++ utility
classes. It also provides a shell script (TclutilConfig.sh), which is
created by the configure script and makes it easier to write configure
scripts for other packages by providing configuration information,
such as the locations and names of all the Tcl extensions and
libraries. The development environment here includes C++, Itcl, TclX,
BLT, Tkimg, and optionally other packages that can be linked in
dynamically as needed.

You can use this package by including the following line in a Tcl script:

	package require Tclutil
